# Shopify-BackEnd-Project-Image-Repository
This is my submission for the summer 2021 Shopify BackEnd Developer Position :)

## How to run the project
First, git clone this repository into your local desktop.

Second, open your terminal, cd into the directory of this folder and copy and paste these commands into the terminal:
`npm install -g yarn` `pip install Flask` or `pip3 install Flask`.

Third, go to the directory of this folder, then:
  1. cd flask-backend
  2. python3 image.py

  
 Now it should give you the link (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) and just click and enjoy! :)
